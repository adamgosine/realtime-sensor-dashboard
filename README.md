# Real-Time ESP32 Sensor Dashboard (High-Speed 100 FPS Visualization)

A complete real-time control system demonstrating embedded sensor acquisition, WiFi TCP streaming, and high-frequency desktop visualization. The ESP32 collects sensor readings (LDR + Joystick), computes an error signal, drives a servo, and streams telemetry to a Python dashboard built with PyQtGraph.

# System Overview

### **What the ESP32 Does**
- Reads **LDR** and **joystick** values through ADC  
- Computes:  
  `error = ldr_normalized - joystick_normalized`  
- Maps the error to a servo angle  
- Streams a high-frequency JSON packet (200+ Hz) over WiFi  
- Sends:  
  ```json
  {"ldr": ..., "joy": ..., "error": ..., "servo": ...}
  ```

### **What the Python Dashboard Does**
- Opens a TCP socket to the ESP32  
- Parses incoming newline-delimited JSON  
- Updates four real-time plots at **100 FPS** using PyQtGraph  
- Shows:
  - LDR sensor waveform  
  - Joystick input  
  - Error signal  
  - Servo output in degrees

# Hardware

### **Components Used**
- **ESP32 Dev Module**  
- **LDR + 10kΩ resistor** (voltage divider)  
- **Joystick module**  
- **SG90 / MG90S servo motor**  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  
- Micro-USB cable  

### **Wiring Summary**
| Component | ESP32 Pin | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| LDR (voltage divider output) | GPIO 32 | ADC1 channel |
| Joystick X-axis | GPIO 34 | ADC1 channel |
| Servo signal | GPIO 4 | PWM capable |
| Servo VCC | 5V | External supply recommended if load applied |
| Servo GND | GND | Must share ground with ESP32 |

The servo *may make noise even with no load attached* due to idle PWM jitter.
